<h1 id="What is SQL and how does it work?">What is SQL and how does it work?</h1>
<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language, it's the syntax one uses to extract or insert data into a database. There's a general basic form that most SQL databases follow and then each database has specific quirks. The basic form is something like this:</p>
<p><code>SELECT column1,column2 FROM table WHERE column3='value'</code></p>
<p>In this example, <code>column1</code>, <code>column2</code>, <code>table</code>, <code>column3</code>, and <code>value</code> are all data parameters and <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FROM</code>, and <code>WHERE</code> are reserved SQL keywords. SQL databases hold all the important data for a website. Things like usernames, password hashes, cookies, products, comments, preferences, etc. are all usually held in some type of database. This is all the critical stuff developers want to protect and all of it is readable and writeable by the SQL engine.</p>
<h1 id="High Level Description of SQLi">High Level Description of SQLi</h1>
<p>SQL Injection (SQLi) occurs when an attacker controls part of the query. If the attacker has a lot of control and the database has access to a lot of important data, an attacker can change the logic of the query to give more information than it should or to modify the contents of the data.</p>
<p>The safe way to perform a lookup from SQL operation is to hard code the query as a string literal. When the developer does this, they have total control over what the query does and no user of the website can modify that query. However, websites are interactive and need to receive inputs from their users to figure out which data to serve. The user has to be able to specify part of the query for the site to be functional. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do this.</p>
<p>The wrong way to do it is to let the user's input help build part of the query string literal. Something like this:</p>
<p><code>query = "SELECT column1,column2 FROM table WHERE column3='" + user_input + "'"</code></p>
<p>In this method instead of inputing some search value into <code>user_input</code>, an attacker can input control characters to finish the first query and start another query that they can write from scratch. Maybe they input something like <code>dummy_value' UNION SELECT username,pass FROM users_table--</code>. This will cause the database to execute and append the results of a second query to the results displayed to the user, displaying all the usernames and passwords for the website. We'll break down this example more in the <code>Why Is It a Vulnerability?</code> section.</p>
<p>The right way is to use a prepared statement (also called a parameterized query). In this method, the query string is still hard coded by the developer, but inputs from the user are indicated through a specific control character (often question mark <code>?</code>) rather than concatenating them onto the query. This way the structure of the query itself gets compiled before the data enters it, disallowing any additional queries or logic. The SQL database knows that any input stuck into the <code>?</code> indicator should be treated as data only, not as an SQL control character than can manipulate query logic. Parameterized statements are very different depending on programming language and database, but a random, easy to follow example is something like:</p>
<pre><code>$stmt = prepare(&#39;INSERT INTO tbl VALUES(?)&#39;);
execute($stmt, array(&quot;user_input&quot;));</code></pre>
<h1 id="Why Is It a Vulnerability?">Why Is It a Vulnerability?</h1>
<p>SQL Queries have two parts to them, control characters and data characters. SQLi happens when the user is allowed to enter control characters into the query. In the query</p>
<p><code>SELECT column1,column2 FROM table WHERE column3='value'</code></p>
<p>The control characters are the keywords <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FROM</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, all the spaces, the comma, the equal sign, and the apostrophes. They instruct the database what to do, what data input to expect, when to start and stop interpreting input as data, and what operations to perform.</p>
<p>The data characters are <code>column1</code>, <code>column2</code>, <code>column3</code>, <code>table</code>, and <code>value</code>. They tell the database what to look for, whether that be column names, table names, or data values. If a developer structures the logic of their query correctly, they can safely limit what the user can query, perhaps by querying from a specific table, specific column names, or setting a specific boolean condition. If an attacker can input control characters, they can change the logic of the query to break out of any constraints the developer has set for them.</p>
<p>This is called a channeling vulnerability and it comes in many forms. Anytime both control characters and data characters can be entered into the same channel, developers must be careful that users cannot enter control characters into that channel. If they can, whatever power the underlying code has can be transferred to an attacker. In this case, database engines have the power to read and write all data involved in a web page, and that is the impact of an SQLi.</p>
<p>To dive deep on one example, if we have</p>
<p><code>query = "SELECT column1,column2 FROM table WHERE column3='" + user_input + "'"</code></p>
<p>and an attacker enters:</p>
<p><code>dummy_value' UNION SELECT username,pass FROM users_table--</code></p>
<p>We end up with: <code>query = "SELECT column1,column2 FROM table WHERE column3='dummy_value' UNION SELECT username,pass FROM users_table--'"</code></p>
<p>Here, <code>dummy_value</code> could be anything (or even just blank). Then the apostrophe is a control character entered by the user to complete the SQL query early. <code>UNION</code> is a control word that tells the SQL engine to basically fire up another query and append it to the previous one that we just ended. Then the <code>SELECT username,pass FROM users_table</code> is a query that gives the attacker all the information they are looking for. Finally, there is still a pesky <code>'</code> character at the end that a developer hardcoded. If the attacker just leaves the query here that apostrophe might cause the database to throw an error and not return any results to the attacker. So the solution is to insert the control characters <code>--</code>, which tell the database that anything that comes after it is a comment and to just ignore them. That's the heart of SQLi. There are a lot more little tricks and gotchas that complicate it, but this mixing of control characters with data characters is what really makes this a vulnerability.</p>
<h1 id="How to spot it, How to automate finding it">How to spot it, How to automate finding it</h1>
<p>SQLi requires some type of user input, so the first step is to find URL parameters or POST arguments. Then, exploiting it always (maybe almost always, but I can't think of a counter-example) involves starting with an apostrophe to close out of whatever data section the input is quoted in. Then there are many database- and instance-specific things that can happen. The trick is essentially figuring out how the page is supposed to work normally, then seeing if anything changes when you go through the list of things to try.</p>
<p>There seem to be several tools for finding SQLi. For researching this topic, I should probably learn what they are, but I haven't yet. It seems like SQLi doesn't require adversarial thinking and site specific information, so it would be possible to automate it. I should gather a lot of CTF problems with SQLi, find all the automated solvers, and see which one is the most successful. I'm not going to do this right now because I think one of the good ones is going to come with Burp Pro and I'm waiting on that, but this is a TODO for me.</p>

<h1 id="Random Bits of Info That Are Helpful for SQLi">Random Bits of Info That Are Helpful for SQLi</h1>
<ul>
<li>SQLi can happen directly from the URL bar with no proxy. The encoding will happen automatically.</li>
<li>Oracle requires all <code>SELECT</code>s to come from a table, even if a table isn't really necessary to the logic. You can use table <code>DUAL</code> or <code>dual</code> for this purpose.</li>
<li>MySQL requires a space after <code>--</code> for comments and sometimes URLs leave off a trailing space, so you should put something else after the comment marker, like <code>-- -</code></li>
<li>If you only have one column to leak things, you can concatenate them together <code>SELECT username || '~separator~' || password from users--</code></li>
<li>You may need to URL-Encode key characters in POST arguments sometimes. This is especially true for things like semicolon which should be %3B</li>
<li><code>SUBSTRING(column_name, position, length)</code> (Oracle uses <code>SUBSTR()</code> instead of <code>SUBSTRING()</code>)</li>
